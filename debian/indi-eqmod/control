Description: INDI EQMod Driver.
 .
 This driver is compatible with any INDI client such as KStars or Xephem.
 This INDI driver interacts with a mount controller using the Skywatcher Protocol through a serial link.
 It can directly drive Skywatcher and similar mounts through a serial port after a conversion of signal levels (see EQDIRECT interface), or any other mount hardware which uses this protocol.
