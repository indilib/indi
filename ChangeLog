             + Added INDI Observer pattern to enable flexible inter-driver communication.
             + getINDI now supports BLOBs.
             + LX200 Drivers use client timestamp to update the telescope internal clock. The old behavior was to use to system's time.
             + Added a new INDI Standard Property: UTC_OFFSET.
             + Dropping threaded INDI server in favor of the slightly better non-threaded version due to performance considerations.

        # Bugs
             + SBIG CCD driver was updated to fix problems with CFITSIO.
             + Updated TTY API to include error reporting, in addition to fixing a few bugs.
             + Fixed INDI Mac OSX Crash.

        # Known Issues
             + Astrophysics Mount driver (apmount) is not working. It is currently under new development and is intented to be released in the next version as it matures.
             + Meade LPI exposure is locked to 1 second. The Video4Linux support for timed exposures is limited. A fix should be available in the next release.
             + The SBIG driver does not allow autoguiding. When one selects the guider CCD, any exposure on the imaging CCD is cancelled and vice-versa.
