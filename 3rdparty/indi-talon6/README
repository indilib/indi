Version 0.1: Provides only basic functionalities like open (unpark) / close (park) / abort and also reads the status from the device. 
All other features will be in a next version, like sync, move to position, snoop devices for mount / weather shutdown. 
Use it under strict control as mount / devices could be hit by the roof.
