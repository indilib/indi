How to Use
==========

You can use the driver in any INDI-compatible client (such as KStars or Xephem) - just select 
the Armadillo / Platypus from the focuser list

To run the driver from the command line:

$ indiserver indi_armadillo_focuser

or

$ indiserver indi_platypus_focuser

You can then connect to the driver from any client, the default port is 7624.
If you're using KStars, the drivers will be automatically listed in KStars' Device Manager.

Select the port the focuser motor is attached to, if not the Main (which is the default) and then
save the settings; nothing else is needed for our standard motors.

As a check list, the default motor options are:
- Half step: off
- Wiring: Lunatico normal
- Motor type: unipolar
- Speed: 9800 (matches 10 ms/step)
