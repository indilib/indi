Apogee CCD Library
==================

This archive contains the standalone version of the Apogee
device drivers for Linux. In order to use this library
you will need to provide code to allocate memory for the 
image data, and routines to save the images to disk, and/or
display them. A more fully featured driver package is 
available from http://www.randomfactory.com/downloads.

This package is primarily intended for developers wishing
to add Apogee camera control options to their software.

Dependencies
============

The code requires the standard GNU gcc build tools.
Both C and C++ compilers are needed. External
dependencies include the libcurl package (ALTA-E
model cameras), and libusb (ALTA-U model cameras).

Installation
============

	See INSTALL
