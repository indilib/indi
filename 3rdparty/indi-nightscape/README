Nightscape 8300 INDI Driver
===========================

This package provides the INDI driver for the Celestron Nightscape 8300 line of CCDs.

Requirements
============

+ libindi0 >= v1.7 (http://indi.sf.net)

	You need to install both libindi0 and libindi-dev to build this package.
	
+ libcfitsio >= 3.0

	libcfitsio3 is required to compile support for FITS.
	
+ libusb

	libusb-devel is required.
	
+ libftdi1

	libftdi1-devel is required

+ D2XX library
	
	This is optional, but the driver is much more stable with this instead of libfti1
	This is binary-only, proprietary to FTDI and can be downloaded from:
	http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/D2XX.htm
	
Installation
============

	See INSTALL
	
How to Use
==========

	You can use the Nightscape INDI Driver in any INDI-compatible client such as KStars or Xephem. 
	
	To run the driver from the command line:
	
	$ indiserver indi_nightscape_ccd

	You can then connect to the driver from any client, the default port is 7624.
	If you're using KStars, the driver will be automatically listed in KStars' Device Manager,
	no further configuration is necessary.

Supported Features
==================
Subframing
Binning (Hardware vertical) of 1, 2 or 4. 
Note horizontal bining is implemented in software.

Exposure times from 1ms to 3600s.
Fan Speed
Temperature setpoint.
Cooler On/Off

Special Feature
===============
If you have both D2XX and libftdi1 installed, the driver will let you choose which 
one to use at runtime. This is under the 'USB Library' tab.

Known Issues
============
The nightscape driver is very sensitive to USB performance, and will drop packets during 
download occasionally.
This will corrupt the downloaded images. If you get fewer than 2506 ines for a full frame 
download you will probably have some image corruption, or at least missing lines. 
This behaviour is much better with D2XX insted of libftdi libraries.

Make sure you don't have anything else using your USB bus and don't run CPU intensive 
background programs, especially video playback.
The USB performance of older Raspberry Pi models is _not_ sufficient to run this.

If you understand and accept all the security implications, the driver can be run setuid root.
It will drop privileges after increasing its priorty to -20.
I do not provide instructions for how to do this here as you really do need to know what you 
are doing.
