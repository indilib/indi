Astromechanics INDI Driver
========================

This is the INDI driver for Astromechanics Lens Controller https://astromechanics.org


How to Use
==========

See the INSTALL file for installation instructions.
If you start INDI manually, include the driver into indiserver command:
$ indiserver indi_astromechfoc

Alternatively when using other software like KStars to start INDI server, just select the driver when starting.

Then connect to INDI server with any software acting as indi client.
Find the Astromechanics tab and switch to Options tab. Check the port setting, by default it is /dev/ttyUSB0 but it may be different if other similar devices connected to the system.
If the port is correct, click connect in the "Main control" tab. After successful connection more properties should be visible and focuser status should be updated instantly.

Set Apperture of your lens in Astromechanics/MainControl. Only the index could be set and not the right apperture. 0 indicates apperture completly opened (for example f/2.8), 22 indicates apperture closed (for example f/32).
