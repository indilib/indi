QSI Linux API README

The QSI Linux API is supplied in source code form and is built and installed using the standard GNU auto tools.

The QSI API supports two driver libraries for the USB connection to the the camera via an FTDI USB interface.  You may use either
libftdi (an open source release), or libftd2xx from FTDI (a binary release - www.ftdi-chip.com) for that connection.  
The choice is mutually exclusive; You cannot confgure both libraries simutaneaously.  
During the build proces, use the configure command to select the ftdi library of your choice.

To use libftd2xx, use the --enable-libftd2xx option on the ./configure command:

./configure --enable-libftd2xx

To use libgftdi, use the --enable-libftdi option:

./configure --enable-libftdi

The ./configure defaults to libftdi if no option is specified.

See the QSI Linux API Reference Manual for more information.

Install libftd2xx or libftdi and their dependencies before building and installing the QSI API.

********************************************************************************************************

Installation

Insure that the kernel is configured for USB support and the device permissions are correct. 

With root permissions:

--------------------------------------------------------------
If you have selected libftdi:

Download, compile, and install libftdi-0.19
Insure that libubs-0.1 is installed, as required by libftdi.
--------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you have selected libftd2xx:

Download, compile, and install libftd2xx. (Available at: http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/D2XX.htm )

Modify the ftdi_table file provided in the libftd2xx release, to include the VIDs and PIDs for QSI cameras.  
Compile and install it as directed by the README from the libftd2xx release.  For more information see the
installation section of the QSI Linux API reference manual located in the doc directory of the release.

Insure that libusb-1.0 is installed, as required by libftd2xx.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Extract the release files from the qsiapi tar archive.
	
	tar -xvf qsiapi.6.2.0.0.tar.gz
	
Run configure:
	
	In the extracted qsiapi.6.2.0.0 directory
	
	./configure --enable-libftdi
	
	 ---or based on your library selection---
	 
	./configure --enable-libftd2xx
	
	make all
	make install
	

Confirm the installation of the include and library files.
	The include files qsiapi.h and QSIError.h are installed in /usr/local/include. 
	The libraries libqsiapi.so, libqsiapi.a, etc. are installed in /usr/local/lib. 

Run ldconfig for the newly installed libraries:
	cd /usr/local/lib
	ldconfig /usr/local/lib

Insure that the device permissions are correct.  Update udev or add the following 
line to /etc/fstab (if it does not already exist):

	none /proc/bus/usb usbfs defaults,devmode=0666 0 0

And remount all in the fstab file
	mount -a
	
Connect the QSI camera to AC power and connect the USB cable from the camera to an available 
USB port on the computer. Use usbview (available at http://www.kroah.com/linux-usb/) or lsusb 
to verify proper USB installation.

Confirm that all libraries are loaded and the system is properly configured.

Run qsiapitest in the src subdirectory:

	./qsiapitest
	
	qsiapitest first displays the version of the api. If there is a QSI camera connected to the system, 
	it will execute a series of command to exercise the camera. See the qsiapitest.cpp source code for further details.
	
**************************************************************************************************************

Troubleshooting:

You may need to install the g++ compiler and other build tools to run the above. If so, run: 
	apt-get install build-essential

If you have problems with the installation steps above, first use usbview or lsusb to
 confirm that the USB file system is mounted properly and the QSI camera is connected to the system.

Some problems may be related to the ftdi_sio driver loading. You must unload this driver (and usbserial)
 if it is attached to your device ("rmmod ftdi_sio" and "rmmod usbserial"as root user).

Insure that the user running the api has read/write access to the camera usb raw device. Check the permissions
 in /dev/bus/usb/XXX/YYY, where XXX is a hub number and YYY is the device number obtained from lsusb.

To set device persmissions other than root:

udev changes:

For example, to give rw access rights to all users for all QSI USB cameras in Fedora:

In the file /etc/udev/rules.d/50-udev-rules,

after:
"Persistent block device stuff - end"
and before:
ACTION="add", SUBSYSTEM='usb-device'...

Add the following lines:
ACTION="add", SUBSYSTEM=usb-device', \
SYSFS{idVendor}=="0403", SYSFS{idProduct}=="eb48", \
PROGRAM="/bin/sh -c 'K=%k; K=$${K#usbdev}; printf bus/usb/%%03i/%%03i $${K%%%%.*} $${K#*.}' ", \
NAME="%c", MODE="0666"

In Ubuntu 6:

In the file /etc/udev/rules.d/40-permisssions.rules

after:
#USB devices (usbfs replacement)
SUBSYSTEM=usb_device, MODE=0664

Add the following line:
SUBSYSTEM=usb_device, SYSFS{idVendor}==0403, SYSFS{idProduct}== eb48, MODE=0666
